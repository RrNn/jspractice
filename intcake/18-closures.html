	Something is wrong with the following code...what is it?

	A. Every time you click a button, you will get undefined. A reference to btnNum is passed
	to each onClick callback. At the end of the loop, btnNum will be 3, and there is no third
	index in the list of prizes.


	<script type="text/javascript">
	    var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Fresh Laundry!'];
	    for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
	        // for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
	        document.getElementById('btn-' + btnNum).onclick = function() {
	            // tell her what she's won!
	            alert(prizes[btnNum]); //btnNum is always 3
	        };
	    }
	</script>
	If you assigned btnNum to 0 at the end of the script, all 3 would read "A Unicorn!".

	The expected behavior is that each time you click a button you see a different prize.
	A way to fix this could be to make a CLOSURE around the callback, via an IIFE, and pass
	the current btnNum to that closure. See below.

<button id="btn-0">Button 1!</button>
<button id="btn-1">Button 2!</button>
<button id="btn-2">Button 3!</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
    var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Fresh Laundry!'];
    for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
        // for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
        document.getElementById('btn-' + btnNum).onclick = function(btnNum) {
        	return function() {
            // tell her what she's won!
            alert(prizes[btnNum]);
        	};
        }(btnNum);
    }
</script>
